Data, process and output of   Hadoop test Question 1

# Q1: 
Calculate the average salary of each 'Senior' employee. Please upload the final CSV along with the code and jar files(if any) to your github and provide the link below. The CSV should be formatted as empid, Name, Designation, Avg_salary


Here In this question I have to get the all "Senior" employees record from employees table along with emp.no and salary and designation.

To get this done I have used below quries as:

**Query one:

"" 
INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/vishnu/Documents/1stquestion_csv' select e.first_name,t.title from employees e left join titles t on e.emp_no = t.emp_no where t.title like '%Senior%';
""
Using above query I am getting the all Senior employees list from the title table under employees database.
here I have used leFt join to get the employee first_name  from employee table, and made left join on Title table on emp.no column and taken the all employee records which have Senior string in it.

and then I have taken average salary of all above output record with Senior employee records.
Here under senior category I found two types of senior emplyees are present in given data.
1. Senior Staff
2.Senior Engineer.
Using these both emploee list along with emp.no, name, salary I have performed average function on it and got average salary of senior staff and senior engineer 


**1. Query to get average salary of Senior staff emloyees:

INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/vishnu/Documents/Q2_senior_Stuff_avg' select avg(s.salary) from employees e left join titles t on (e.emp_no = t.emp_no) left join salaries s on (e.emp_no = s.emp_no) where t.title like '%Senior Staff%';

In above query I have performed action to get average salary on salaries table and made 2 left joines on it.
one left join on titles table and another one left join on the salaries table  both on emp.no column 
 and the output of this quesry stored in local derictory in csv format.
 
 **2.Quesry to get average saalry of Senior engineer employees:
 
 hive> INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/vishnu/Documents/Q1_senior_Engineer_CSVavg' select avg(s.salary) from employees e left join titles t on (e.emp_no = t.emp_no) left join salaries s on (e.emp_no = s.emp_no) where t.title like '%Senior Engineer%';
 
 Same , in above query I have performed average function on salaries table along with two left join on Titles and salaries on both emp.no column with getting matching employee records which have Senior Engineer.
 
 
 In this way I get the average salary of all Senioer ( Senioer staff and Senior Engineer) employees along with the emp.no , Emp name, Designation and Average salary.
 
 **Added File Deatils as:
 
  1. Directory "1question_csv_all_senior_liststaffandEng" in this directory  I have genrated CSV file "000000_0"
which consist the All Senior (Staff and Engineer) employees list.

2. "Q1_senior_Engineer_CSVavg" in this directory  I have generated CSV file "000000_0" which display the Average salary of all "Senior Engineer" employees.

3. "Q1_senior_Stuff_avg" In this directory I have generaed the CSV file "000000_0"  which consist the Average Salary of all "Senior Staff" employees.

4. "seniorEnggList" under this directory I have exported and generated CSV file "000000_0" file for  the All Senior Engineer employees list using below query 
 "INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/vishnu/Documents/1stquestion_csv' select e.first_name,t.title from employees e left join titles t on e.emp_no = t.emp_no where t.title like '%Senior Engineer%';"
 
 5."seniorStaffList" in this directory I have exported the all senior  Staff employee list in CSV "000000_0".
 
 6."Termial_SeniorEnginerAVG" this is text fle I have added, and in this text file I have added the Terminal output got for  All Senior Engineer employees Average Salary.Here You can find the all process how the query runa dn how the map reduce worked.
 
7. "Terminaloutputforsenioremps" in this text file I have added the terminal out put which I got after runing the all senior employees query, in this file you can check how the query run and the process happneded on mapreduce with all details.
 
 8. "terminaloutputforSenior_staff" In this text file I have added the termial output of Senior staff average salary and how I have exported this query result in CSV file and stored in local path. I.e. "000000.0".
